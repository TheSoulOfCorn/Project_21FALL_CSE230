# Project_21FALL_CSE230
- **Farming simulator based on brick**
- This is a farming simulator game based on the brick library. The relieving farming game has been popular for years, focusing on the virtual experience of farmer life with planting, breeding, and more. Our application is to simulate the world-famous game based on brick.
- In this project, our main goal is to create a virtual plantation where the user can plant vegetables and fruits. The user can choose different game mode they prefer. The classic mode contains a settled loops (or days in our game) and the user has limited power, and he aims to get higher score in the limited time. The gamer has lands where he can plant, and he can choose whatever he like to plant.
- To balance the game, plants with shorter growing period yield less score than those longer. The plants suffer from pests, drought and so, which have the gamer to regularly water and take pest control. Of course, all these take the power of a day, so the user has to balance whether to plant a lot, or just focus on few. Since plants die from the drought and pest will even lower the score. The user has to take all the risk and have an elaborated plan of how to use up the power every day, though luck is part of the game.
- To embellish, we then introduce more uncertainties like the plant stealer, someone steals your plant and you get nothing. Also fertilizers, things help your plant grow faster and gain more score.
- Hopefully our strategy game would have a nice user interface to attract everyone.
